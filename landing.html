												<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I’ve always been interested in the computing side of information technology. My interest started when my dad gave me and my sister a laptop when i was five years old. I would always use the laptop, i played games, watched videos and browse the web on it. I fell in love with computers since then. The reason why i chose to study at RMIT, is because RMIT is well known for their technology courses and also because RMIT’s SNAP program with my school. Through my course, I hope to learn how to do programming and eventually develop something entertaining. I also want to learn web design, hoping to be able to create a website from scratch. Another thing I hope to learn about is cyber security, i just find it interesting and hope to be able to do something relating to it.
