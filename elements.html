										<h2 id="content">Overview</h2>
										<p>My project will be a game that i created with the use of Unity as it is able to support me with the essential basic tools to help produce the game. It will be a single player game, to make it easier since it is my first project, but i want to expand it to a multiplayer game later on if possible. I want my game to be used in a virtual reality system, such as the HTC Vive, so the player is able to freely interact with the environment using their imagination.</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Motivation</h3>
												<p>Virtual reality gaming has been on the rise since last year, and I took an interest in it, its still new and i hope to create something that will stand out and be enjoyable for the gaming community. Virtual reality has only been a concept and not been very practical until the recent years, so why not take the opportunity now to put the current technology to use and create something that might blow up even more in the future with more virtual reality technology to come.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
												<p>Tools required for the the project would include a stable computer that will be able to manage and store all the work and information relating to the project, and a cloud or storage device that can be used as a backup. A virtual reality headset would be required for some testing, such as the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift. The computer would require Unity to be able to develop the project with its tools assisting the developer to create a 3D world and implementing the virtual reality to the project.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Skills Required</h3>
												<p>An understanding on how to use the Unity engine will be required in order to produce the project with the desired engine, such understanding will include world construction, entity programming, etc. In order to create a game for the virtual reality headset, an understanding of how the virtual reality headset works and functions. Such skills can be achieved through practising using the Unity engine and reading up on how virtual reality works.</p>
