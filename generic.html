I enjoy coding, putting together lines of codes that come together that does something cool. The only reason why I find this appealing is because I want to pursue something that i will enjoy and love. In order to achieve my job, I would need to learn website design and development, programming languages, learn to manage databases, learn to lead people in projects and learn about user experience. Through the next few years at RMIT, I am hoping I will be able to gain the skills and knowledge to be able to pursue my dream career.

										<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									</header>
									<p>From doing the Myers-Briggs Test, i have the personality type ISFP-T which is also known as the adventurer personality. Adventurer personalities are free spirited like people, who do what they want to do. Through doing the learning style test, I am a visual learner, i learn best in an environment where i am able to see things to learn from. From conducting a Big Five Personality test, I am mostly an introverted person, I am not that emotionally stable, however I am a very agreeable person and somewhat optimistic. I am an impulsive and disorganized person , and i am a person who tends to be traditional and conventional. My personality may cause harm to potential group work as i might not be able to pull my part as i am disorganized and impulsive which could lead to some issues. Also because of my introverted personality, i could be afraid to speak out my opinion or even ask for a superior’s advice or help. Being a visual learner, i could just look on how to do it and learn from that rather than asking. Being introverted could also mean, that i don’t disturb others and trouble them as often as extroverts. When forming a team, I would be best to put together someone that works well with my personality, such as an extrovert who helps me out of my comfort zone, or comes to me when I seem to need help without asking, or a person who is a type of learner who gains by teaching others. These tests may not ultimately decide my personality and the type of person I am, I can adapt and change to suit my working environment and strive to be a person able to work in group conditions.
